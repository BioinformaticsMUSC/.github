## About Bioinformatics Core

The Bioinformatic Core at MUSC (BioCM) provides an extensive range of bioinformatics data analysis services to MUSC faculties, biotech/pharmaceutical companies, and research organisations. 

The BioCM services are designed to provide bioinformatic solutions and acquire data for a broad range of applications including metagenomics, cancer genomics, microbial genomics, non-model system genomics, transcriptomics, epigenomics, and the most advances single cell multiomics. Our skilled data analysis group can help to move your bioinformatics research project forward in a number of ways, and we have the experience to assist you at every step of the process

## The Vision

The BioCM strives to accomplish this mission by maintaining a skilled staff and state-of-the-art equipment, and by providing cost-effective services ranging from consultation to data generation and processing. We gladly provide investigators biostatistical, bioinformatic, and sequencing consultation services to guide researchers towards the effective design, execution, and analysis of their studies and research questions. We further offer support to researchers at the pre-proposal phase to help researchers win competitive grant funding and at the manuscript phase in method writing and data visualization.
